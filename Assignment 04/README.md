Exercise 01: Regression to the mean:

4) What do you observe? You may need to run the loop a few times to see it.
5) How is this related to "regression to the mean"?

Exercise 02: Regression Model :
6) Assess the quality of the regression (visually and using numbers) in your own words.
   As the output is:  
Coefficient or slope  : 7.717287640785383
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 12.218571272826035
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 9.746718764605346
R-squared (R²): 0.8551742120609958

The scatter plot shows a clear upward trend as the taller people generally have more weight. A straight-line model fits this relationship quite well. The regression line suggests that on average for increase in 1 inch the weight is increased by 7.7172. 

The model isn’t perfect because People’s weights depends upon various  reasons besides height. SO, the predictions can be off by around 12.218. Still, the R² value of about 0.855 tells us that height alone explains most of the variation in weight.
